# Part 4: Agentic GraphRAG with Neo4j

**Format:** Instructor-led demo + resources  
**Goal:** Understand different approaches to building agentic GraphRAG systems and see Text2Cypher in action

---

## üéØ Overview

In Parts 1-3, we built a knowledge graph from pharmaceutical PDFs. Now we'll explore how to consume this graph using **agentic patterns** that allow AI assistants to autonomously query and reason over our data.

An **agentic GraphRAG system** combines:
- **Graph Database** (Neo4j) - Structured knowledge
- **LLM Agent** - Natural language understanding
- **Tools** - Actions the agent can take (e.g., Text2Cypher queries)
- **Orchestration** - Logic for planning and executing multi-step tasks

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Three Approaches to Building Agentic GraphRAG

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ No-Code: Aura Agents (Aura Pro/Business Critical)

**What it is:** Built-in agent creation interface in Neo4j Aura Pro and Business Critical tiers.

**Best for:** Quick prototyping, non-technical users, production-ready deployments

**Features:**
- Visual agent builder
- Pre-configured Text2Cypher tool (other tools are Vector Similarity and Cypher Template)
- Managed infrastructure
- Authentication and access control

**Learn more:** [Neo4j Aura Agents Documentation](https://neo4j.com/developer/genai-ecosystem/aura-agent/)

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Model Context Protocol (MCP) with Claude Desktop

**What it is:** Connect Claude Desktop directly to your Neo4j database using MCP servers.

**Best for:** Interactive exploration, rapid testing, personal workflows

**How it works:**
1. Install [Neo4j MCP](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher) server in Claude Desktop
2. Claude gains access to Text2Cypher tools 
3. Ask complex questions in natural language
4. Claude automatcally access the database and executes Cypher queries in reasoning loop until it has information to answer the question

**MCP Resources:**
- [Neo4j MCP Documentation](https://neo4j.com/developer/genai-ecosystem/model-context-protocol-mcp/)
- Multiple MCP servers available


---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Custom Agents: LangGraph + MCP Template

**What it is:** React agent template with customizable tools and workflows.

**Best for:** Production applications, complex workflows, full customization

**Features:**
- React agent architecture (Reasoning + Acting)
- MCP integration for Neo4j tools
- Extensible tool framework
- Full control over agent behavior

**Template Repository:** [text2cypher-react-agent-example](https://github.com/neo4j-field/text2cypher-react-agent-example)

## üì• Download Pre-Built Database

To follow along with the demo, you'll need the pharmaceutical knowledge graph we extracted in Part 3.

### Download the Database Dump

**üîó [Download Neo4j Dump File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ma9Cvq-COHsQvEBh2kKcLou8OgOcSLLT/view?usp=sharing)**

*File size: ~13 MB | Contains: pharmaceutical pipeline data extracted from the 4 documents*

### Loading the Dump in Neo4j Aura

1. **Create a new Aura instance** (Free or Pro)
2. Download the `.dump` file (link above)
3. In your Aura console:
   - Click the three dots (‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢) next to your instance
   - Select "Backup & restore"
   - Select "Restore from backup file"
   - Upload the `pharmaceutical-graph.dump` file
   - Wait for import to complete (~2-5 minutes)
4. **Connect** using the provided credentials

**Credentials for Demo Instance:**
- URI: `neo4j+s://your-instance.databases.neo4j.io`
- Username: `neo4j`
- Password: `(will be provided during workshop)`

## üé¨ Live Demo: Claude Desktop + MCP

In this demo, we'll use **Approach #2** (MCP with Claude Desktop) to query the pharmaceutical knowledge graph.

### Setup Steps (Instructor)
Follow the steps to [install a local MCP server in Claude Desktop](https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/mcp-neo4j/tree/main/servers/mcp-neo4j-cypher#-usage-with-claude-desktop)

### What We'll Query

Using the knowledge graph from Part 3 (pharmaceutical pipeline data), we'll demonstrate various query patterns:

---

## üí° Example Queries to Try

### Basic Queries

```markdown
Which companies have the most molecules for oncology?
```

```markdown
What molecules are targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 across all companies?
```

```markdown
How many molecules are targeting KRASG12C, and which diseases are they treating?
```

```markdown
What are the most common targets for Alzheimer's Disease therapies?
```

### Competitive Intelligence

```markdown
Analyze our oncology pipeline versus competitors: compare target diversity, 
clinical phase distribution, and trial completion timelines‚Äîwhere are we 
strongest and weakest?
```

```markdown
Which disease indications have multiple of our molecules competing internally, 
and what are the differentiation factors (target, phase, trial design, endpoints)?
```

```markdown
Identify novel target-disease associations that only one or two companies are 
exploring‚Äîwhat is the scientific rationale and probability of technical success?
```

### Strategic Analysis

```markdown
Map the relationship network: which targets are associated with which diseases, 
and which molecules target multiple related pathways‚Äîare there synergistic 
combination opportunities?
```

```markdown
Identify orphan targets (high-value diseases with few molecules in development)‚Äî
which companies have early-stage programs that could be acquisition targets?
```

```markdown
Analyze the partnership networks: which companies frequently collaborate with 
each other, and on what types of assets (target class, indication, phase)?
```

```markdown
What molecules in our pipeline are being developed in partnership?
```

## üîç What Makes This "Agentic"?

Notice how these queries require:

1. **Planning** - Breaking complex questions into sub-queries
2. **Tool Use** - Converting natural language ‚Üí Cypher ‚Üí Results
3. **Reasoning** - Synthesizing data from multiple queries
4. **Domain Knowledge** - Understanding pharmaceutical terminology and relationships

The agent (Claude) autonomously:
- Generates Cypher queries
- Executes them via the MCP tool
- Analyzes results
- Formulates follow-up queries if needed
- Provides natural language answers
